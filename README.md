This project analyzes the spread of COVID-19 in Nigeria using data from [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus).

## What I Did

## What I Learned
- How to use `tidyverse` and `janitor` for data wrangling
- How to plot with `ggplot2`
- How to write my first data analysis project

## Next Steps
- Explore trends in deaths and vaccinations
- Add interactivity with `plotly` or `shiny`
